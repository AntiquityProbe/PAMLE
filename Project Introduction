üß± Project Advanced Mesh-Loader Engine (PAMLE)
PAMLE is a browser-based platform for the visualization, annotation, and interpretive segmentation of high-resolution 3D archaeological meshes. Designed for archaeologists, heritage professionals, and digital humanists, PAMLE enables direct interaction with mesh data through face selection, feature labeling, and metadata-rich annotation‚Äîall rendered in real time using WebGL technologies.

Built with Three.js, Flask, and open-source Python libraries, PAMLE supports a lightweight and extensible approach to 3D documentation and analysis. It transforms raw mesh models into structured interpretive environments, allowing users to mark architectural features, flag points of interest, attach images and metadata, and export labeled datasets in human-readable formats.

üîç Core Features

Annotation modal with customizable metadata fields

Feature marker system for pinpoint annotation

Heatmap visualization based on interpretive density

RESTful API for data persistence (labels, annotations, images)

Open, local-first deployment (runs in a browser via Flask)
